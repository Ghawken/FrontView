Changelog:

1.212
Add Other/Settings - No Fanart on HomeScreen setting for Kodi
This disables Fanart display if on the main menu within Kodi
(other deeper menus eg. Tv/Movies will display relevanat fanart)
(needs Kodi frontview service running)

Enables - Time/Weather display to remain unless browsing deeper menus.

1.211
Change WeatherFanart to be more compatible
Will check for Wunderground icon condition ie. mostlycloudy.jpg image - if not found will also check
numbered condition i.e 31.jpg as well

Added support for Multiple Weather Backdrop Fanarts:
Same format as Kodi - download Weather Fanart Backdrops.   Multiple numbered folders ie folder 0, folder 42 etc
Add these to %appdata% Skin/Default/Weather/Backgrounds/
Only checks Default skin location for these folder, multiple fanarts.
If folders exists - will default to using these - if doesn't exist back to single images

Adds support for multiple weather fanart Backdrops (based on current conditions!)
Uses the included and downloaded Kodi ones (thanks)

The attached zip file of Directories 0-41 needs to be extracted into

%appdata%\FrontView+\Skin\Default\Weather\Backgrounds\

eg:  Directory 40:
C:\Users\testuser\AppData\Roaming\FrontView+\Skin\Default\Weather\Backgrounds\40\

FrontView+ will then use these directories (for ever skin selection) for the background of the Weather screen and also background of Time/Weather screen.  
It will cycle through them all every 2 minutes or so 


1.210
Add Time/Weather Screen - selectable as home screen
Click FrontView Icon/Image Top Left to return to this screen
Add Option - to "Stay on Home Screen" in Settings/Other

Under DDC/Amp in Settings - will only work with monitors that support DDC (and unsure re USB Monitors)
Allows FrontView to control the monitor settings directly (same as adjusting monitor menu settings)
