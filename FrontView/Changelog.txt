1.230
Change to UDP Fanart Client/Server
(better for slightly dicey connections; wifi Tablets etc)
Updates Kodi Frontview.Service addon to v2 UDP

Correctly turns off and turns on - screens if option selected
This does seem dependant on windows version/updates - currently functioning on my windows 10 tablet


Useful for standalone tablet usage - dims and then screen off
(if playback stopped, or paused - screen should turn back on again)

To avoid going to the lock screen in windows 10 - need to follow some instructions as below:
https://www.cnet.com/au/how-to/how-to-disable-the-windows-10-lock-screen/

Change to .net .4.6.1

1.216
Fix partlycloudy weather backdrops
Enable turn off screen setting (beta currently)

1.215
Fix settings comestic lines (defining NowPlayng Screen)
Add Turn OFF Screen with DDC Control Setting
(this wil turn off screen completely - yah completely dark
but will turn off ALL screens (limitation of DDC)
Obviously only useful when using Tablet or standalone computer for FrontView+
as otherwise video screen will turn off.)


1.214
Change Duration/Time on NowPlaying Screen size to slider
Settings/Display/Now Playing Section - Time Size
(will not suit all screen sizes and will need to be adjusted for each)

1.213
Fix bug related to visibility of time/weather
Add Super Lge - size for Time/Duration
(will move to slider when have time)

1.212
Add Other/Settings - No Fanart on HomeScreen setting for Kodi
This disables Fanart display if on the main menu within Kodi
(other deeper menus eg. Tv/Movies will display relevanat fanart)
(needs Kodi frontview service running)

Enables - Time/Weather display to remain unless browsing deeper menus.

1.211
Change WeatherFanart to be more compatible
Will check for Wunderground icon condition ie. mostlycloudy.jpg image - if not found will also check
numbered condition i.e 31.jpg as well

Added support for Multiple Weather Backdrop Fanarts:
Same format as Kodi - download Weather Fanart Backdrops.   Multiple numbered folders ie folder 0, folder 42 etc
Add these to %appdata% Skin/Default/Weather/Backgrounds/
Only checks Default skin location for these folder, multiple fanarts.
If folders exists - will default to using these - if doesn't exist back to single images

Adds support for multiple weather fanart Backdrops (based on current conditions!)
Uses the included and downloaded Kodi ones (thanks)

The attached zip file of Directories 0-41 needs to be extracted into

%appdata%\FrontView+\Skin\Default\Weather\Backgrounds\

eg:  Directory 40:
C:\Users\testuser\AppData\Roaming\FrontView+\Skin\Default\Weather\Backgrounds\40\

FrontView+ will then use these directories (for ever skin selection) for the background of the Weather screen and also background of Time/Weather screen.  
It will cycle through them all every 2 minutes or so 


1.210
Add Time/Weather Screen - selectable as home screen
Click FrontView Icon/Image Top Left to return to this screen
Add Option - to "Stay on Home Screen" in Settings/Other
(stops changing to remote selection screen after 20 seconds if no remote connected)
(Still connects automatic when Kodi player up and running)

Addition of DDC/CI Monitor Settings Control:
Under DDC/Amp in Settings - will only work with monitors that support DDC (and unsure re USB Monitors)
Allows FrontView to control the monitor settings directly (same as adjusting monitor menu settings)
Enables FrontView to completely lower brightness and contrast during playback - avoiding a blank yet still 'bright' screen
