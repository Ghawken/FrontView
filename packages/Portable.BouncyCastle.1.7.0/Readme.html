			DERObject becomes Asn1Object
			<li>
			DEREncodable becomes Asn1Encodable
			<li>
			GetDERObject() becomes ToAsn1Object()
			<li>
			BERConstructedOctetString becomes BerOctetString
			<li>
			If you were using the older mutable DERConstructedSequence/Set and 
			BERConstructedSequence, use an Asn1EncodableVector in conjunction with 
			DerSequence/Set and BerSequence
			<li>
			BERInputStream and DERInputStream are replaced with Asn1InputStream
			<li>
				AsymmetricKeyParameter is now in the Org.Bouncycastle.Crypto namespace</li>

		<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId211208"></a>How To Build.</h3>
		<p>
			The BC C# API uses NAnt (<a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/">http://nant.sourceforge.net</a>) 
			to provide a platform independent build environment (suggested version NAnt 0.90).
			There is also a solution file for Visual Studio, and for MonoDevelop. The API works
			with .NET Framework 1.1 and above. It has been successfully built and tested with Mono
			versions from 1.1.13 onwards. The source code can be built for .NET Compact Framework 1.0
			by setting the compilation flag NETCF_1_0, or .NET Compact Framework 2.0 by setting NETCF_2_0,
			or Silverlight 2 by setting SILVERLIGHT.
		</p>
		Using a command prompt (DOS window), cd into the 'crypto' folder of this 
		distribution.<br>

		&nbsp;<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Java® heritage,</span><br>
		<br>
		The Bouncy Castle C# API is a port of the Bouncy Castle Java APIs. 
		Approximately %80 of the functionality in the Java build has now been ported. 
		For the most part, the naming conventions of the .NET platform have been 
		adopted. The C# API is constantly kept uptodate with bug fixes and new test 
		cases from the Java build (and vice versa sometimes), thus benefitting from the 
		large user base and real-world use the Java version has seen.<br>
		<br>
		<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Please consider.</span><br>
		<br>
		The Bouncy Castle C# API is a library of transformations that when combined 
		properly will enable developers to create standard conforming cryptographic 
		systems. In order to use this API you must have some knowledge of how to build 
		cryptographic systems, namely what transformations to use and the when, where 
		and why of their use.<br>
		Developing good cryptographic systems takes practice and understanding.<br>
		<br>
		There are many resources available online and in book shops; please use those 
		to your advantage.<br>

Bouncy Castle JIRA C# 1.6</a></li>
</ul>
		<H4><A class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId85310"></A>Release 1.5, Tuesday August 18, 2009</H4>
<h5>Defects Fixed</h5>
<ul>
<li>Correct the ASN.1 class for AuthorityInformationAccess.</li>
<li>In the Bcpg libs, armored output now inserts the correct version string.</li>

<li>EAX mode ciphers were not resetting correctly after a DoFinal/Reset. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>Some boolean parameters to IssuingDistributionPoint were being reversed. This has been fixed.</li><li>A zero length RDN would cause an exception in an X509Name. This has been fixed.</li>
